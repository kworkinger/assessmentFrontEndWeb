		Welcome to my super basic website which features an awesome cat meme at the top. This
		is no ordinary website. It's a website that kind of works, and if it doesn't I'm failing
		this assessment. If this doesn't work, go to another website and you will find better
		meme's, documentation, markup, styling and dynamic effects. Thank you and have a great
		day!
	</p>
	<ul>
		Now my compliments to you fine people:
		<li>Congratulations, you're alive and healthy enough to be on the internet right now.</li>
		<li>You look like a human being. Awesome!</li>
		<li>You are cool enough to be on here when you could be doing anything else.</li>
	</ul>
